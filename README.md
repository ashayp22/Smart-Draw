# Smart Draw

![](smartdraw.png)

See if the AI can guess your drawing! If you draw well enough, you earn points! Else, you lose all your points!

This fun game allows you to see how well you can draw. Given three topics, choose the one you are most familiar with and draw it. If the AI recognizes it, you earn points. Otherwise, you lose all your points.

 I made this during the my Junior year of high school (Fall 2019).
